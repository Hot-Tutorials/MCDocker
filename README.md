# MCDocker
## Status: Not Done
MCDocker is a custom launcher and instance manager for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net). It lets you manage containers (Game Instances) which you can share and let others experience your custom container. This will let you download mods, maps / worlds, texture packs and skins by only clicking a button!
